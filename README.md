## 1. Business Case Definition
Our claims costs are increasing significantly. We suspect a rise in fraudulent claims and underwriting mismatches. We need insights into fraud trends and risk profiles to 
improve decision-making and reduce costs.

Success Metrics

- Increase fraud detection rate (precision & recall)

- Identify high-risk profiles for better underwriting

- Track average claim amount by risk group

- Deploy a dashboard to visualize fraud trends by agent, region, vehicle type, etc.
